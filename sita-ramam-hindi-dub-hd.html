            The film's screening was banned in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
            Emirates.[21] According to an article published by News18, the ban was a result of the film hurting
            religious sentiments.[22] Later, the ban in the United Arab Emirates was lifted and the film released on 11
            August 2022.[23] A pre-release event was conducted in Hyderabad in 3 August 2022 with Prabhas attending as
            guest.[24] The team promoted the film at events in Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Vizag, Chennai and Kochi.
