        <p>K.G.F: Chapter 2 is a 2022 Indian Kannada-language period action film written and directed by Prashanth Neel,
            and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner Hombale Films. It is the second instalment in a two-part
            series, sequel to the 2018 film K.G.F: Chapter 1. The film stars Yash, Sanjay Dutt, Srinidhi Shetty, Raveena
            Tandon and Prakash Raj. It follows the assassin Rocky, who, after establishing himself as the kingpin of the
            Kolar Gold Fields, must retain his supremacy against adversaries and government officials, while also coming
            to terms with his past. <br/><br/>
            Produced on a budget of ₹100 crore (US$13 million), KGF: Chapter 2 is the most expensive Kannada film. Neel
            retained the technicians from its predecessor with Bhuvan Gowda handling the cinematography and Ravi Basrur
            scoring the music for the soundtrack and the film's background. Dutt and Tandon joined the cast in early
            2019, marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions of the film were shot back-to-back with Chapter 1.
            Principal photography for the rest of the sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in February 2020
            owing to the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later and was completed in December
            2020. Locations included Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore and Kolar. <br/>

            KGF: Chapter 2 was theatrically released in India on 14 April 2022 in Kannada, along with dubbed versions in
            Telugu, Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam languages. It is also the first Kannada film to release in IMAX. The film
            received mixed reviews from critics with praise towards performances and visuals but criticised the story
            and narration. <br/><br/>
